# Hello! I'm Premiare, or Brayden.

## I'm a Front-End Developer from Melbourne.

### My main tech stack is:
- HTML5
- CSS
- Bootstrap 5
- JavaScript ES6
- Node.js

I'm currently looking for a job in Web Development, so all my current projects are self-inspired and self-progressing. Git pushes are here and there, but a lot of my work is done without pushing to repo at the moment.

### Current projects and interests:
- AI powered image publisher; requesting images with voice commands.
- Hospitality business websites; with my background in hospitality, I want to develop better websites for restaurants and bars.
- Sheriff Bot; a discord bot for moderation and fun commands
- POS systems to optimize the efficiency of hospitality and retail businesses.

### For any business enquiries or queries, please send me an email to: braydenbarterwebdev@gmail.com
